                <p class="rightPos"><strong>Inheritance is ability of creating a new class from an existing class.</strong> Like the word Inheritance literally means it is a practice of passing on property, titles, debts, rights and obligations upon the death of an individual. in OOP this is somehow true, where The base class has properties and methods that will be inherited by the sub class and it can have additional properties or methods.</p>

                <p class="leftPos"><strong>Polymorphism is the ability of an object to change behavior on runtime.</strong>Just like in biology, Polymorphism refers to the ability to take into different forms or stages. A subclass can define its own unique behavior and still share the same functionalities or behavior of its parent/base class.Yes, you got it right, subclass can have their own behavior and share some of its behavior from its parent class not the other way around. A parent class cannot have the behavior of its subclass.</p>

                <p class="rightPos"><strong>Encapsulation is not data hiding, but Encapsulation leads to data hiding</strong>We have to take in consideration that Encapsulation is somehow related to Data Hiding. Encapsulation is when you hide your modules internal data and all other implementation details/mechanism from other modules. it is also a way of restricting access to certain properties or component.</p>

                <p class="leftPos"><strong>Abstraction reduces code complexity and at the same time it makes your aesthetically pleasant.</strong>Abstraction is a process of exposing essential feature of an entity while hiding other irrelevant detail. Why would you want to use abstraction?</p>
